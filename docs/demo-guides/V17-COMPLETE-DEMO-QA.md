Notice the impact analysis - a $10K schedule delay might be worse than a $50K budget increase if the schedule affects other projects. CRs with decision deadlines approaching need urgent stakeholder meetings. Delays in approvals block development teams."

---

#### Query #4: Meeting Coordination

**Question**: `Show upcoming stakeholder meetings`

**Answer**: "Upcoming stakeholder coordination meetings with DNR program office:"

**Widget**: `stakeholder-engagement-dashboard`

**What You'll See**:

- Completion status

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/stakeholder-lead/05-action-items.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "Action items are promises made to stakeholders. This tracker ensures nothing falls through the cracks. Overdue items in red damage credibility - stakeholders lose confidence when commitments slip. Notice 'days open' - anything over 30 days is probably abandoned and should be formally closed or re-assigned. Before every stakeholder meeting, review their open action items - closing them builds trust."

---

#### Query #6: Requirements Traceability

**Question**: `Show requirements traceability matrix`

**Answer**: "Requirements traceability matrix shows coverage from business needs to implementation:"

**Widget**: `requirements-tracking-dashboard`

**What You'll See**:
- Requirements mapped to design documents

- Traceability percentage (target: 100%)

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/stakeholder-lead/06-traceability.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "Traceability proves you're building what stakeholders asked for. This matrix connects requirements to implementation to testing. Orphaned requirements mean stakeholder needs aren't being met. Orphaned implementations mean developers are building things nobody asked for. Both are waste. The traceability percentage should be 100% - anything less means gaps in your requirements management process."

---

#### Query #7: Default Stakeholder Dashboard

**Question**: `Show stakeholder management dashboard` (or any unmatched query)

**Badge**: PM (Indigo)
**Focus**: Sprints, velocity, capacity, burndown
**Demo Page**: http://localhost:3018/demo/project-manager
**Total Queries**: 6

---

#### Query #1: Sprint Velocity

**Question**: `Show current sprint burndown`

**Answer**: "Sprint 24 velocity tracking shows current progress against commitment:"

**Widget**: `sprint-burndown-chart`

**What You'll See**:
- Sprint name and number (Sprint 24)
- Sprint goal clearly stated
- Start and end dates
- Burndown chart (ideal line vs actual line)
- Current velocity (story points/day)
- Days remaining in sprint
- Completion forecast (on-track/at-risk)
- Stories completed vs remaining

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/project-manager/01-sprint-velocity.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "The sprint burndown is your daily pulse check. The blue line is ideal burn - steady progress each day. The red line is actual burn - if it's above ideal, you're behind. Notice the forecast - it predicts if you'll complete the sprint based on current velocity. If the forecast shows you'll finish with 5 days to spare, you undercommitted. If it shows you'll miss by 3 days, you overcommitted. Use this to improve future sprint planning."

---

#### Query #2: Team Velocity Analysis

**Question**: `Show team velocity trend analysis`

**Answer**: "Team capacity analysis indicates velocity trends across the last 6 sprints:"

**Widget**: `team-velocity-dashboard`

**What You'll See**:
- Last 6 sprints displayed as bar chart
- Committed story points (planned)
- Completed story points (actual)
- Velocity per sprint
- Average velocity calculated
- Trend line (improving/stable/declining)
- Predictability percentage (% of commitments met)

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/project-manager/02-team-velocity.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "Velocity trends tell you if your team is accelerating or decelerating. A healthy team shows stable or improving velocity. If velocity is declining over 3+ sprints, something's wrong - technical debt, team churn, or burnout. Notice predictability - teams that complete 90%+ of commitments are trustworthy for planning. Teams below 70% are over-committing. Use average velocity for sprint planning, not wishful thinking."

---

#### Query #3: Resource Capacity

**Question**: `Show resource capacity for current sprint`

**Answer**: "Resource allocation for current sprint shows team availability and utilization:"

**Widget**: `resource-capacity-dashboard`

**What You'll See**:
- Team members listed with availability
- Hours allocated per person
- Utilization percentages (target: 70-85%)
- Over-allocated team members flagged (>100%)
- Under-utilized team members (<50%)
- PTO and meetings accounted for
- Available capacity for unplanned work
- Skills matrix showing who can do what

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/project-manager/03-resource-capacity.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "Resource capacity prevents sprint failure before it happens. Anyone over 100% will miss commitments. Anyone under 50% may be blocked or have skills mismatch. The target zone is 70-85% - productive without burnout. Notice PTO and meetings are pre-subtracted - if someone has 2 days of meetings this sprint, they can't commit to 10 days of work. Always leave 15-20% capacity for unplanned work - production issues, urgent bugs, stakeholder requests."

---

#### Query #4: Sprint Planning Data

**Question**: `Show historical velocity for sprint planning`

**Answer**: "Sprint planning data shows historical velocity for capacity-based commitment:"

**Widget**: `sprint-burndown-chart`

**What You'll See**:
- Average velocity from last 6 sprints
- Best velocity (highest sprint)
- Worst velocity (lowest sprint)
- Velocity standard deviation
- Confidence intervals
- Recommended commitment range
- Capacity adjustments for holidays/PTO

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/project-manager/04-sprint-planning.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "Sprint planning should be data-driven, not gut-driven. Your average velocity is your commitment baseline. The standard deviation shows consistency - low deviation means predictable team. High deviation means inconsistent execution. Never commit to best-case velocity - that's setting up for failure. Commit to average velocity, adjusted for PTO and holidays. Under-promise and over-deliver beats the reverse every time."

---

#### Query #5: Sprint Blockers

**Question**: `Show current sprint blockers`

**Answer**: "Blocker resolution status requires immediate attention from scrum master:"

**Widget**: `blocker-resolution-dashboard`

- Assigned resolver
- Resolution status and progress
- Impact assessment (# of stories blocked)
- Escalation status

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/project-manager/05-blockers.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "Blockers are velocity killers. Every day a story is blocked is a day of lost progress. This dashboard shows blockers by time blocked - anything over 2 days needs scrum master escalation. Notice impact - one blocker might be blocking 3 stories, effectively blocking 30% of the sprint. Resolvers must be assigned with target resolution dates. If a blocker can't be resolved within the sprint, remove the blocked stories and replace with unblocked work."

---

#### Query #6: Default Sprint Dashboard

**Question**: `Show sprint dashboard` (or any unmatched query)

**Answer**: "Sprint dashboard shows current iteration progress and team velocity:"

- Code smells count and severity
- Technical debt estimated hours
- Security vulnerabilities (critical/high/medium/low)
- Code duplication percentage
- Complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity)
- Quality trends over 6 months
- Recent PRs with quality gates status

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/service-team-lead/01-code-quality.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "Code quality metrics prevent future pain. Test coverage below 80% means bugs will slip through. Code smells accumulate over time - above 100 means you're accruing technical debt faster than paying it down. Security vulnerabilities are non-negotiable - any critical or high severity must be fixed within 1 sprint. Notice the trend - if quality is declining, you need to add refactoring time to sprints. Quality doesn't happen by accident."

---

#### Query #2: Deployment Pipeline Health

**Question**: `Show deployment pipeline status`

**Answer**: "Deployment pipeline health indicates CI/CD success rates and build times:"

**Widget**: `deployment-pipeline-dashboard`

- Time to recover from failure
- Environment status (dev, staging, production)

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/service-team-lead/02-deployment-pipeline.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "A healthy pipeline is a fast, reliable pipeline. Success rate below 95% means your tests are flaky or your code is unstable. Rollbacks are expensive - each one costs hours of engineer time and damages user trust. Notice deployment duration - if it's over 30 minutes, you're slowing down feedback loops. The goal is multiple deployments per day with <5 minute cycle time. Fast deployments enable fast iterations enable fast learning."

---

#### Query #3: Technical Blocker Resolution

**Question**: `Show technical blocker resolution status`

**Answer**: "Technical blocker resolution requires engineering team intervention:"

**Widget**: `blocker-resolution-dashboard`

**What You'll See**:

- Affected developers
- Time blocked (hours/days)
- Severity (critical, high, medium)
- Assigned resolver
- Resolution progress and notes
- Escalation path

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/service-team-lead/03-blocker-resolution.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "Technical blockers destroy team velocity. Every blocked developer is 8 hours/day of lost productivity. This dashboard prioritizes blockers by impact - a blocker affecting 3 developers is 3x more urgent than one affecting 1 developer. Anything critical should be resolved within 4 hours. Anything high should be resolved within 1 day. If you can't resolve in time, escalate to architecture or management immediately."

---

#### Query #4: Team Workload Overview

**Question**: `Show team performance and workload`

**Answer**: "Team performance tracking shows developer workload and sprint capacity:"

- Over/under utilized team members
- Burnout risk indicators
- Skills coverage matrix

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/service-team-lead/04-team-workload.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "Team workload isn't about micromanagement - it's about preventing burnout and spotting blockers. A developer with 5 open PRs might be blocked on reviews. A developer with 0 completed PRs in 3 days might be stuck on a technical problem. Notice code review responsiveness - if reviews take >24 hours, you're slowing the entire team. Balance workload so no one is over 85% utilized. Leave slack for urgent issues and learning."

---

#### Query #5: DORA Metrics Performance

**Question**: `Show DORA metrics analysis`

**Answer**: "DORA metrics analysis reveals deployment frequency and lead time performance:"

**Widget**: `deployment-pipeline-dashboard`

**What You'll See**:
- Deployment Frequency (deployments/week or /day)

**Demo Script**:
> "DORA metrics measure engineering excellence. Elite teams deploy on-demand (multiple times/day) with <1 hour lead time, <15 minute recovery, and <5% failure rate. If you're deploying weekly with days of lead time, you're in the Low tier. Each tier jump dramatically improves business outcomes. Focus on one metric at a time - usually deployment frequency first, which forces improvements in the others. You can't improve what you don't measure."

---

#### Query #6: Default Quality Dashboard

**Question**: `Show code quality analysis dashboard` (or any unmatched query)

**Answer**: "Code quality analysis dashboard displays technical health and engineering excellence:"

**Widget**: `code-quality-dashboard`

- Engineering health overview

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/service-team-lead/06-default-fallback.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "The default quality dashboard is your technical health check. It's what you'd show to the Director of Engineering - overall quality score and trends. A declining quality score predicts future production incidents. Use this in weekly team retrospectives. Ask: 'What's one thing we can do this sprint to improve our quality score?' Small improvements compound over time. Quality is a team habit, not an individual skill."

#### Query #1: My Task Board

**Question**: `Show my task board for today`

**Answer**: "Your task board shows current sprint assignments with priority and status:"

**Widget**: `task-kanban-board`

P2/P3 can wait if higher priorities emerge. Notice blocked tasks flagged in red - escalate these to your team lead immediately. The sprint progress bar shows collective team progress - you're not alone in this sprint."

---

#### Query #2: Sprint Task Assignments

**Question**: `Show my sprint task assignments`

**Answer**: "Sprint assignments require completion before next standup meeting:"

**Widget**: `task-kanban-board`

**What You'll See**:
- Tasks due before next standup

- Sprint deadline countdown
- Commitment vs completed story points
- Tasks at risk of missing sprint goal

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/service-team-member/02-sprint-tasks.png`

**Demo Script**:

Notice tasks at risk - these are behind schedule and need attention or re-estimation. Don't wait until the last day of the sprint to discover you're behind. Update task status daily so the team has accurate information."

---

#### Query #3: My Blockers

**Question**: `Show blockers affecting my work`

**Answer**: "Blocker status for your work requires team lead escalation:"

**Widget**: `blocker-resolution-dashboard`

**What You'll See**:
- Your blocked tasks listed
- Blocker descriptions
- How long you've been blocked (hours/days)
- Who can unblock you (assigned resolver)
- Escalation status
- Workaround suggestions
- Alternative tasks you can work on

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/service-team-member/03-blockers.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "Blockers are not failures - they're collaboration opportunities. The moment you're blocked, flag it in this system. Don't suffer in silence for days. Notice the escalation status - if your team lead can't resolve it within 4 hours, it escalates to architecture or management. While blocked, see alternative tasks you can work on. Never let blockers idle you - there's always something productive to do."

---

#### Query #4: My Code Quality Issues

**Question**: `Show code quality issues in my pull requests`

**Answer**: "Code quality issues in your PRs need attention before merge:"

**Widget**: `code-quality-dashboard`

- Security vulnerabilities (if any)
- Complexity violations
- Reviewer feedback
- Approval status

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/service-team-member/04-code-quality-issues.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "Code quality gates prevent technical debt from entering the codebase. A failing quality gate means your PR can't merge yet. Common issues: test coverage drops, new code smells, or high complexity. Fix these before requesting review - it respects reviewers' time. Notice reviewer feedback - address every comment before marking 'resolved'. Approved PRs should merge within 24 hours to avoid conflicts."

---

- View counts (popular articles)
- Last updated dates
- Categories/tags
- Quick preview/summary
- Related articles

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/service-team-member/05-knowledge-base.png`

**Demo Script**:
> "The knowledge base is your first stop before asking for help. Search for error messages, technical concepts, or 'how-to' questions. Notice relevance scores - 90%+ articles are usually exactly what you need. Check last updated date - articles over 1 year old might be outdated. If you solve a problem not in the KB, write it up and add it. Future developers will thank you."

---

- Today's focus
- Team velocity
- Quick status overview

**Screenshot**: `/demo-screenshots/service-team-member/06-default-fallback.png`

**Demo Script**:

- ✅ Connect queries to real pain points ("Remember last quarter when we missed that budget overrun?")
- ✅ Use visual language ("Notice the red flags", "See the green health scores")
- ✅ Let stakeholders ask questions - every query has follow-up answers prepared

### DON'T:
- ❌ Apologize for the demo environment ("This is just demo data...")
- ❌ Read response text word-for-word - paraphrase naturally
- ❌ Rush through queries - give stakeholders time to absorb visualizations
- ❌ Oversell capabilities - be honest about what V17 can and can't do
- ❌ Skip the "why" - always explain why this query matters to the persona
